        <div id="About_text">
          <p>Hi, I'm Stephen Chalmers! What's your name?</p>
          <p>In February 2023, I became interested in the rise and fall of Parler (and analysis of its data) after being
            asked to write the chapter
            “Selfies, Biometrics, Geolocation, and the 2021 Capitol Hill Riot: How Photography is Used in the Service of
            Surveillance” for the book <a
              href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Companion-to-Photography-Representation-and-Social-Justice/Neumuller/p/book/9781032112947"
              target="_blank"><em>The Routledge Companion to Photography, Representation and Social Justice</em></a>
            (Taylor &amp; Francis, ISBN: 978-1-032-11294-7). Among other topics in this chapter, I discussed how
            facial recognition was used to identify suspected participants of the Capitol Hill riot, from videos scraped
            from Parler.</p>

          <div class="parloc_map">

                A GIS map I generated to show the distribution of the 64,520 posts in the cleaned dataset</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The social media site '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler/">Parler</a>,' was launched on 08
              August 2018 by John Matze and Jared Thomson. Associated with extreme conservatives, the platform marketed
              itself as a “free speech” alternative (meaning fewer content policies) to other networks such as Twitter
              and
              Facebook.</p>
          </div>

          <p>During 2020, Parler experienced a significant surge in popularity during the lead-up to the U.S.
            presidential election. Many users flocked to the platform, believing it provided a platform for unfettered
            conservative political discourse - while others viewed the network as amplifying extremist, racist, sexist
            and violent content, along with conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Following the storming of the U.S. Capitol on 6 January 2021, Parler faced increased scrutiny due to its
            role
            in facilitating the planning and organization of the insurrection. The application was removed from Apple's
            App Store and Google Play, and on 10 January 2021 Amazon Web Services (AWS) terminated Parler's hosting
            services,
            after finding the company in breach of contract for failing to identify and remove posts by users that
            called for the “rape, torture, and assassination” of elected officials, police officers, and public-school
            teachers - removing the hosting effectively took the platform offline.</p>

          <div class="donk">
            <figure>
              <figcaption><img src="PL_Assets/images/donk_enby copy.jpg" width="200" height="200"
                  alt="Donk Enby, with Gurken Prinz pickles">
                @donk_enby (Credit: Twitter)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> Prior to deplatforming, a user named '@donk_enby' used a Python script to copy ~8TB, or ~99% of the
              publicly available data uploaded to the platform, due to the platform's poor coding and lax security
              (including sequentially numbered posts, and no rate limiting of downloads).</p>
          </div>



          <p>Of the 1.1 million videos in the downloaded tranche, geolocation data was present in about 6%. This
            web-based application searches through those 64,520 (after I cleaned the data) geotagged video posts for
            those closest
            to your entered location.</p>

          <p>Of the geotagged videos, <a href="https://backspace.com/parler-capitol/" target="_blank">618 were directly
              linked to the storming of the U.S. Capitol</a> - which federal prosecutors <a
              href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-capitol-arrests/u-s-says-capitol-rioters-meant-to-capture-and-assassinate-officials-filing-idUSKBN29K0K7?il=0"
              class="links" target="_blank">stated</a> involved a plot “to capture and assassinate elected officials.”
            These 618
            geotagged and other (non-geotagged) videos from that day were used in the second impeachment of Donald
            Trump, as well as the arrests/convictions of many of the other <a
              href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/capitol-breach-cases" target="_blank">participants to the Capitol
              Hill riot</a>.</p>
          <h1> Coding, Data and Such</h1>
          <p>The dataset contains longitude and latitude to four decimal places - meaning it can be assumed to have
            an accuracy of approximately +/- 36 feet (11 meters) in North America. Other than the location, date and
            post number, other identifiable information (such as
            user name) was stripped out of the dataset.</p>


          <p>If you enter a location on the following page, it is forward geocoded - and if you use the browser location
            query it is reverse geocoded to the Map Maker <a href="https://geocode.maps.co/" target="_blank">Geocoding
              API</a>. The Java
            backend calculates distances using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula"
              target="_blank">Haversine
              Formula</a> - a trigometric approach dating to the very start of the 19th century. The Haversine formula
            determines the great-circle distances between points on a sphere* given their longitudes and latitudes.
          </p>
          <p>After calculating the distance between your (entered or queried) latitude/longitude and each of the 64,520
            posts, the results are sorted and you are provided the number of posts requested in order of
            proximity,
            along with formatted links to Google Maps, Google Street View, and Google Directions from your location to
            the location associated with the Parler post. Originally conceived as a fully Google Maps API project, it
            was changed to the free Map Maker API to eliminate cost (with the assumption I would post it for public
            use). Note that the chosen API is rate limited to two requests per second, so if this application exceeds
            that, you may receive a <a href="https://httpstatusdogs.com/429-too-many-requests" target="_blank">HTTP
              429</a> response.
          </p>
          <p>* Even ignoring surface topography, Earth isn't a sphere (it is more of an ellipsoid/squished
            spheroid shape), but the Haversine is a fairly simple formula that is also very accurate with close points
            (just less so with greater distances).<br>&nbsp;</p>
